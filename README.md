## 🏛️ The Five Pillars That Hold the Sky

Writing code with AI is fast, but how do you know if the code is **good**?  
In the AFO Kingdom, we do not judge by machine speed alone, but by five ancient convictions:

1. **眞 (Truth / 진실)**: Technical accuracy and verifiability. bow to what *is*.
2. **善 (Goodness / 선함)**: Ethical stability. Does this bring the Commander peace?
3. **美 (Beauty / 아름다움)**: Clarity and elegance. Beauty is mercy for the reader.
4. **孝 (Serenity / Devotion)**: Ensuring frictionless operation and low cognitive load.
5. **永 (Eternity / 영원함)**: Long-term sustainability and worthy traces.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Simple Mode)

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), just type:

```bash
/check
```

HyoDo automatically checks your code quality and gives you a simple score:

| Score | Meaning | What to do |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **90+** | ✅ Good to go | Ship it! (AUTO_RUN eligible) |
| **70-89** | ⚠️ Needs review | Double-check before merging |
| **< 70** | ❌ Issues found | Fix the problems first |

### 🏛️ Entry to the Kingdom: Installation

```bash
# Clone the intelligence engine
git clone https://github.com/lofibrainwav/HyoDo.git ~/.hyodo

# Enter and initialize
cd ~/.hyodo && ./install.sh

## ⚔️ Navigating with the Three Strategists

Once inside, let the philosophy guide your hand via our core personas:

| Command | Purpose | Pillar |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/start` | The Chancellor’s warm welcome and guide. | 孝 |
| `/score` | Your **North Star**. An intuitive glance at the balance. | 眞善美 |
| `/check` | A deep inspection of technical Truth and Goodness. | 眞善 |
| `/safe` | Call upon the Shield (**이순신**) to guard against risk. | 善 |
| `/trinity` | A detailed audit of all Five Pillars. | 眞善美孝永 |

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 One Sentence

We write code the way a filial son would prepare medicine for his parent:  
**accurately, gently, beautifully, and in a way that remains kind even after many seasons have passed.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Architecture & Scholarship (Advanced)</strong></summary>

The Kingdom functions through a "Visceral Intelligence" system where the Chancellor coordinates scholars and strategists.

- **Scholars (Logic Layer)**: Heo Jun, Jeong Yak-yong, Ryu Seong-ryong, Kim Yu-sin.
- **Strategists (Persona Layer)**: Jang Yeong-sil (眞), Yi Sun-sin (善), Shin Saimdang (美).

All analysis happens locally. Your code never leaves your machine.

Together we keep building toward 永 100%.  
*Initially crafted for the Commander. Now open for any heart seeking Craft & Conscience.*
